## What is SGIARK?

We're a group of MIT and Georgia Tech students. We're not quite sure exactly what we want to build yet, but we are currently trying to build a framework for personal AI agents which we intend to make available to the web for personal productivity purposes.

"ARK" (which is the name we've assigned to what we're building) is an acronym for "Automated Knowledge Resourcebase".

## Repos

- [arkos](https://github.com/SGIARK/arkos): Python-based AI agent framework. It's currently a mess.
- [arkos-webui](https://github.com/SGIARK/arkos-webui): Svelte productivity web app which we intend to build on top of the backend
- [arkos-mcp-calendar](https://github.com/SGIARK/arkos-mcp-calendar) for Model Context Protocol calendar integration
